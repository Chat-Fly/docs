### API Endpoint

The API endpoint for obtaining a streaming response is:

```text

```

### Request Body

To get a streaming response, send a POST request to the API endpoint with a JSON request. Here's an example JSON request:

```json
{
  "bot_id": "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx",
  "message": "string",
  "session_id": "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
}
```

- bot_id (string): ID of your bot.
- message (string): Message from the user.
- session_id (string): ID of the session.

### Example Request

Here are example commands to obtain a streaming response using the ChatFly API:

<CodeGroup>

```json curl
curl -N -X POST "https://backend.chatfly.co/api/chat/get-streaming-response" \
-H 'accept: application/json' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
  "bot_id": "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx",
  "message": "string",
  "session_id": "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
}'
```

```json python
import requests

url = "https://backend.chatfly.co/api/chat/get-streaming-response"
headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
}

data = {
  "bot_id": "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx",
  "message": "string",
  "session_id": "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx",
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data, stream=True)

if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Request successful!")

    # Process the streaming response as needed
    for chunk in response.iter_content(chunk_size=1024):
        if chunk:
            # Process each chunk of the streaming response
            print(chunk.decode('utf-8'), end="", flush=True)
else:
    print("Request failed with status code:", response.status_code)
    print(response.text)

```

```json fetch/javascript
const url = "https://backend.chatfly.co/api/chat/get-streaming-response";
const headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
};

const data = {
    bot_id: "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx",
    message: "string",
    session_id: "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx",
    user_id: "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx",
    sender: "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
};

const decoder = new TextDecoder('utf-8');

fetch(url, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: headers,
    body: JSON.stringify(data),
})
    .then(response => {
        // Check for error response
        if (!response.ok) {
            return response.text().then(errorText => {
                throw new Error(`Request failed with status code:: ${response.status} - ${errorText}`);
        });
        }

        console.log("Request successful!");

        // Otherwise, return the streaming response body
        return response.body;
    })
    .then(stream => {
        // Create a reader to read the stream
        const reader = stream.getReader();

        // Define the function that will handle the stream
        function read() {
            reader.read().then(({ done, value }) => {
                // Check to see if we're done with the stream
                if (done) {
                    return;
                }

                // Convert the value (a Uint8Array) to a string
                const text = decoder.decode(value);

                process.stdout.write(text);

                // Read some more, and call this function again
                read();
            });
        }

        // Start reading the stream
        read();
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error(`An error occurred: ${error}`);
    });
```
