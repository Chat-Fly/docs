description: "What is ChatFly?"
---
**ChatFly** is an AI chatbot builder that utilizes artificial intelligence to analyze your data and allows you to integrate a chat widget into your website. Simply upload a document or provide a link to your website, and you'll have a chatbot capable of answering questions related to the content.

You will even be able to specify a webhook URL on your own server.
Our backend would make an API call to your server whenever the end-user asks a triggering question,
with the inbound query and session information.
This documentation serves as a guide for accessing your ChatFly account using an API.
To get started with the ChatFly API, you will need at least one API Key.
