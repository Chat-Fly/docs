### API Endpoint

The API endpoint for obtaining a streaming response with custom setting is:
```text
https://backend.chatfly.co/api/chat/get-streaming-response-with-custom-settings
```
To get a streaming response, you need to send a POST request to the API endpoint with a Params and JSON request. 
Here's an example Params request:
```params
{
    "type_qa": "String"
}
```
- type_qa (string): type of question message.

And here's an example JSON request:

```json
{
  "bot_id": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
  "message": "Hi",
  "chat_history": [
      {
        "sender_type": "user",
        "content": "Hi"
      },
      {
        "sender_type": "assistant",
        "content": "Hello! How can I assist you today?"
      }],
  "custom_prompt": "I want you to act as an assistant to a customer support agent by writing email responses...",
  "gpt_model_name": "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k",
  "temperature": 0,
  "rules": []
}
```
