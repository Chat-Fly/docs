Authentication is the process of verifying and confirming the identity of a user or entity to ensure that only authorized individuals or entities can access a system or protected resources.

For ChatFly's authentication, API key-based authentication is also employed. Instead of using the Bearer token, users are required to include an API key in the request header. The key must be named "CHATFLY-API-KEY" and hold the user's unique API key.

## How does this work?

### Authentication

After [create API Key](/documentation/quickstart/create-api-key) here. Users must include the API key in the request header for subsequent requests to the ChatFly system.

The API key should be added to the Authorization header with the following format:
```bash
'CHATFLY-API-KEY': '<api_key>'
```

This key serves as proof of the user's identity and is used by the server to verify and authorize access based on the permissions associated with the API key.
